                  When my heart began to fail, it didn&apos;t announce itself with a dramatic crash. 
                  It was quieter than that ‚Äî a breath I couldn&apos;t quite catch, stairs that felt 
                  steeper than they used to, a kind of tiredness that sleep didn&apos;t fix.

                  The doctors called it congestive heart failure, also left side ventricle like

                  was just getting older. Just tired. Just busy. But then came the night I 
                  couldn&apos;t get out of bed without feeling like I was drowning in air. That was 
                  the night my denial ran out.

                  The hospital lights were too bright. The monitors beeped like they were keeping 
                  time for a song I didn&apos;t know the words to. I watched nurses move around me 
                  like I was part of a machine ‚Äî a thing to stabilize. But inside, I was unraveling.
